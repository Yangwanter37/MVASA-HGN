# MVASA-HGN: Multi-View Adaptive Semantic-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Network for KRAS Mutation Status Prediction
**Overview**

Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be a potential biomarker of immunotherapy efficacy. However, existing mutation prediction studies have primarily focused on the feature representation of individual patient medical data, ignoring the complex semantic relationships among patients in diverse clinical features.  This study develops a multi-view adaptive semantics-aware heterogeneous graph framework (MVASA-HGN) based on multimodal medical data to accurately predict KRAS gene mutation status in NSCLC patients.
